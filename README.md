# CNN-Image-Classifier
 This project is an implementation of an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow. The model is trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and can classify images into ten different categories with high accuracy. The project includes data preprocessing, model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
